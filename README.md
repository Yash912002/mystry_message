# Mystry Message

Mystry Message is a platform that allows users to send messages anonymously to other users. Users who want to receive messages need to create an account and share their unique profile link. However, users who only want to send a message do not need to log in or sign up; they just need the recipient's profile URL.

## Features

- **Anonymous Messaging**: Send messages anonymously without the need for an account.
- **User Profiles**: Registered users can receive messages through their unique profile URL.
- **Copy Profile Link**: Easily copy and share your unique profile link to receive anonymous messages.
- **Toggle Message Acceptance**: Registered users can toggle the acceptance of anonymous messages.
